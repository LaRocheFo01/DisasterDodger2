To turn that green “frame” (your blue‐outlined areas) into part of the hero, and shrink those side margins so your content sits wider, you really only need to tweak two things:

1. **Use your field‐&‐house SVG as a full‐width hero background**
2. **Increase the hero’s inner max‐width** so the white content card spans more of the screen

Here’s a drop-in example (using Tailwind) replacing your old hero:

```html
<!-- 1) Full-width hero wrapper with your new SVG -->
<section 
  class="relative w-full h-[36rem] overflow-hidden"
  style="background: url('/assets/hero-field.svg') center/cover no-repeat;"
>
  <!-- 2) Optional dark overlay for contrast (tweak opacity as needed) -->
  <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-white/50"></div>

  <!-- 3) Hero content container -->
  <div class="relative z-10 flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-full
              max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
    <h1 class="text-5xl font-semibold text-text-dark text-center leading-tight">
      Dodge Disasters Before They Strike
    </h1>
    <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 text-center max-w-2xl">
      Five-minute, FEMA-aligned home audit that pinpoints wildfire, flood, hurricane,
      and earthquake risks—so you can act now and save on insurance.
    </p>
    <!-- your ZIP-card goes here -->
  </div>
</section>
```

### What changed

* **`h-[36rem]`** (or whatever height you prefer) makes the hero tall enough to spread the image.
* **`background: url('/assets/hero-field.svg') center/cover no-repeat;`** paints the hills+house behind everything.
* **`max-w-5xl`** (instead of your old `max-w-3xl`) lets the white card expand further into those side areas.
* **`px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`** gives comfortable padding on small screens and more on large.

You can tweak:

* **Height** (`h-[28rem]`, `h-screen`, etc.)
* **Overlay** opacity (`bg-white/30` for a lighter “veil,” or remove if your text is already contrast-y)
* **`max-w-6xl`** if you want it even wider

Once you swap in this `<section>` in place of your old hero, your green margins (blue) will all become part of the background scene, and your content (orange) will stretch nicely across the page.
