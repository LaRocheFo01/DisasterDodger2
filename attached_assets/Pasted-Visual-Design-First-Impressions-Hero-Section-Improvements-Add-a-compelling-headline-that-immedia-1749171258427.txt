Add a compelling headline that immediately communicates value: "Protect Your Home & Family Before Disaster Strikes"
Include a professional hero image showing a safe, prepared home or family
Add trust indicators like testimonials, certifications, or "500+ Homes Protected" statistics
Use warm, reassuring colors (blues/greens for safety, not alarming reds)

Content Strategy for Homeowners
Lead with Emotion & Local Relevance:

Start with local disaster statistics: "In [Your Area], 1 in 4 homes will experience disaster damage"
Use homeowner-focused language: "Your most valuable investment deserves protection"
Add urgency without fear-mongering: "Most homeowners have only 72 hours to prepare when disaster strikes"

Simplify the Value Proposition:

Create a clear 3-step process: "Assess → Plan → Protect"
Show before/after scenarios or case studies
Include cost savings messaging: "Save thousands in potential damage"
